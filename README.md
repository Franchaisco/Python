## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Test 1>

<https://github.com/Timmermans13/Python/blob/Francis-Branch/power_of_num_tests.py>

<The test I have provided tests the with the branch where n is equal to 0 (pow-case-1). This was the only branch that was not covered, hence improving the branch coverage to 100%>

<Test 2>

<https://github.com/Timmermans13/Python/blob/Francis-Branch/balance_parenthesis.py>

<The test I have provided tests the with the branch where the string empty (bal-case-2). This was the only branch that was not covered, hence improving the branch coverage to 100%>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>
